# Dessert Strike

A game loosely based on Desert Strike, but with a dessert based theme (still to be developed).

Created for Game Off 2017 #GitHubGameOff using GameMaker Studio 1.4.

Currently in early development, but will be ready for the end of the jam at the end of November.

Uses the topdown shooter demo which comes with GMS as a framework to get started.
